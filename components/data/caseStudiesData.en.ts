      <h2>Transforming information security in an industrial group</h2>
      <p>
        Cyberhub led the implementation of an <strong>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</strong> 
        based on the <strong>ISO/IEC 27001:2022</strong> standard for a holding company with operations in 
        <strong>Chile and Peru</strong>. The goal was to strengthen data protection processes and 
        establish a culture of security.
      </p>

      <h3>Initial challenge</h3>
      <p>
        The organization faced rapid growth and needed to standardize security controls for audits 
        and regulatory requirements. Multiple units had different levels of maturity and fragmented 
        document management.
      </p>

      <h3>Approach and methodology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial maturity assessment based on <em>ISO 27001 Gap Assessment</em>.</li>
        <li>Risk identification and treatment according to <em>ISO 27005</em>.</li>
        <li>Design and implementation of policies, procedures, and technical controls.</li>
        <li>Training of over 200 employees on information security best practices.</li>
        <li>Internal audit simulations prior to certification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results achieved</h3>
      <p>
        In less than <strong>9 months</strong>, the holding obtained <strong>ISO 27001 certification</strong>, 
        improving international trust and operational efficiency. Security incidents dropped by 
        <strong>45%</strong>, and a permanent security committee was established.
      </p>

      <h2>Compliance diagnosis under Law 21.633 in an energy company</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>energy sector company</strong> requested Cyberhub to evaluate its level of compliance with 
        <strong>Law 21.633</strong>, which regulates <em>Organizations of Vital Importance (OIV)</em>. 
        The goal was to establish a clear diagnosis and an actionable roadmap to reach the required maturity.
      </p>

      <h3>Context and challenge</h3>
      <p>
        The company faced the obligation to adapt to new cybersecurity and operational continuity requirements. 
        However, it lacked a structured framework to assess its readiness according to the 
        <strong>Government CSIRT</strong> guidelines.
      </p>

      <h3>Applied methodology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Information gathering through interviews and document review.</li>
        <li>Maturity assessment based on the <em>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</em>.</li>
        <li>Gap identification against the controls required by Law 21.633 and its technical guides.</li>
        <li>Prioritized action plan with defined milestones and responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Delivery of executive and technical reports with a compliance roadmap.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        The assessment allowed the company to understand its maturity level in 
        <strong>Risk Management, Critical Asset Protection, and Incident Response</strong>. 
        A structured three-phase improvement plan was developed and is now being executed 
        under the supervision of the Corporate Security Committee.
