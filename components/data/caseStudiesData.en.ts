      <h2>Transforming information security in an industrial group</h2>
      <p>
        Cyberhub led the implementation of an <strong>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</strong> 
        based on the <strong>ISO/IEC 27001:2022</strong> standard for a holding company operating in 
        <strong>Chile and Peru</strong>. The goal was to strengthen data protection processes and 
        establish an organizational culture of security.
      </p>

      <h3>Initial challenge</h3>
      <p>
        The organization was growing rapidly and needed to standardize its security controls 
        to comply with audits and regulatory requirements. Multiple business units had different 
        levels of security maturity and fragmented documentation management.
      </p>

      <h3>Approach and methodology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial maturity assessment based on the <em>ISO 27001 Gap Assessment</em>.</li>
        <li>Risk identification and treatment following <em>ISO 27005</em>.</li>
        <li>Design and implementation of policies, procedures, and technical and organizational controls.</li>
        <li>Training for over 200 employees on information security best practices.</li>
        <li>Internal audit simulations to ensure compliance before certification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results achieved</h3>
      <p>
        In less than <strong>9 months</strong>, the holding company achieved <strong>ISO 27001 certification</strong> 
        at the corporate level, strengthening its position with international clients and improving 
        operational efficiency. Security incidents were reduced by <strong>45%</strong>, and a permanent 
        security committee was established.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Cyberhub’s guidance was key to aligning our security strategy with our business goals. 
        Today we have a mature, sustainable, and certified ISMS.”  
        <footer>— IT Manager, Industrial Group</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
      <p>
        The project showed that implementing an effective ISMS requires both executive commitment 
        and active participation from operational areas. The integration of technology, processes, 
        and people was essential for success.

      <h2>Compliance assessment with Law 21.633 in an energy company</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Chilean energy company</strong> requested Cyberhub’s support to evaluate its 
        level of compliance with <strong>Law 21.633</strong>, which regulates 
        <em>Organizations of Vital Importance (OIVs)</em>. The objective was to obtain a clear 
        diagnostic and an actionable plan to reach the maturity required by authorities.
      </p>

      <h3>Context and challenge</h3>
      <p>
        The company needed to comply with new legal requirements for 
        <strong>cybersecurity and operational continuity</strong>, but lacked a structured 
        framework to measure its preparedness against the <strong>Government CSIRT</strong> guidelines.
      </p>

      <h3>Applied methodology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Information gathering through interviews and document review.</li>
        <li>Maturity assessment based on the <em>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)</em>.</li>
        <li>Gap identification against Law 21.633 controls and technical guidance.</li>
        <li>Design of a prioritized action plan with defined milestones and responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Delivery of executive and technical reports with a compliance roadmap.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results achieved</h3>
      <p>
        The assessment allowed the organization to understand its maturity level in 
        <strong>Risk Management, Critical Asset Protection, and Incident Response</strong>. 
        A three-phase improvement plan was designed and is currently under execution, 
        monitored quarterly by the Corporate Security Committee.

      </blockquote>

      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the results, the company began implementing the 
        <strong>NIST CSF Framework</strong> as the foundation for its corporate cybersecurity 
        management system and strengthened its internal audit process.

      <h2>Technical audit and capacity building in cybersecurity</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>national financial institution</strong> engaged Cyberhub to perform a 
        <strong>comprehensive audit of its IT infrastructure</strong> and later train its 
        technical and executive teams on best security practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Initial situation</h3>
      <p>
        The organization aimed to identify critical vulnerabilities and foster an internal 
        culture of cybersecurity. It lacked a continuous review process and a formal training 
        program for its personnel.
      </p>

      <h3>Project stages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Review of architecture and security policies.</li>
        <li>Penetration testing and vulnerability analysis.</li>
        <li>Assessment of controls on servers, networks, and endpoints.</li>
        <li>Development of a prioritized mitigation plan by risk level.</li>
        <li>Design and delivery of technical workshops and executive awareness sessions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Main findings and improvements</h3>
      <p>
        Gaps were found in patch management, access control, and network segmentation. 
        After implementing the action plan, the institution achieved a 
        <strong>60% reduction in critical vulnerabilities</strong> and established a quarterly 
        review schedule.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “The audit helped us understand our true exposure level and prioritize cybersecurity 
        investments. The training sessions transformed the way our teams think about security.”

      </blockquote>

      <h3>Final impact</h3>
      <p>
        The project not only improved the institution’s technical maturity but also fostered a 
        sustainable <strong>cyber resilience culture</strong> supported by performance metrics 
        and automated internal monitoring.

      <h2>Enhancing cyber incident response capability in the healthcare sector</h2>
      <p>
        Cyberhub collaborated with a <strong>healthcare organization</strong> to design and implement 
        a <strong>Security Incident Response Plan (SIRP)</strong>. The objective was to establish 
        a clear and operational strategy to handle cyberattacks that could affect clinical data 
        availability and confidentiality.
      </p>

      <h3>Initial situation</h3>
      <p>
        The organization had experienced security incidents impacting its critical systems and 
        medical records. There were no formal procedures or defined roles for incident handling, 
        leading to delayed responses and reliance on third parties.
      </p>

      <h3>Methodology and approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial maturity assessment of the incident management process.</li>
        <li>Response workflow design based on <em>NIST 800-61r2</em> (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide).</li>
        <li>Definition of roles and responsibilities for the internal <strong>CSIRT team</strong>.</li>
        <li>Implementation of a centralized event tracking system.</li>
        <li>Incident simulations to validate reaction times and communication efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Results and benefits</h3>
      <p>
        The organization reduced its <strong>detection and containment time</strong> for critical 
        incidents by over <strong>50%</strong>. Standardized procedures and automated escalation 
        mechanisms were established according to severity level, integrating response actions 
        with <strong>business continuity</strong> and <strong>cyber resilience</strong> policies.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “We now have a clear structure to respond to any cyberattack. Cyberhub’s preparation and 
        support made the difference in our ability to react.”
        <footer>— Technology Director, Healthcare Organization</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Key lessons</h3>
      <p>
        The experience demonstrated that <strong>organizational preparedness</strong> and 
        <strong>effective internal communication</strong> are critical for successful incident 
        management. Beyond technology, the human factor proved essential for building resilience.
      </p>

      <h3>Next steps</h3>
      <p>
        The plan includes <strong>semiannual drills</strong> and the adoption of a SIEM platform 
        to enhance early threat detection. Cyberhub continues to support the organization in its 
        continuous improvement phase.
